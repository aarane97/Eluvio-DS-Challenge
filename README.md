# Eluvio-DS-Challenge
Repository holding my solutions for the Eluvio DS Challenge

The solutions are present in the ELuvio_Challenge.ipynb file.

A pdf has also been attached along with it, which shows the output in pdf format.

**Problem Statement**

1) Looking for any patterns by visually observing data and doing some processing

2) Creating a simple model using as few features as possible (one feature), to negate the effects of a huge dataset. 

**My observation**

1) 

2) As dataset is large, I tried to remove features and focus on one of the features, namely, the titles of the posts. This enabled me to create highly accurate models using SVM and Logistic Regression, which predict whether a post will lie in the top 85 percentile of the posts.
